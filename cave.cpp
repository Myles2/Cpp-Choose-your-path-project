#include <iostream>
#include "Paths.h"

std::string cave()
{
  std::cout << "It's dark and eerie" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}


/* Create a path you want to create and hide the key 
somewhere in the path for the user to find also change 
the name to this file to whatever you want the theme to 
be like dungeon, sewer, village, space_ship 

Also you can make the key whatever you want but let myles know so he can change 
the keys that must be found in the home function or if you want you can use the
default which is: Key 3 == 4001

If you find a bug try to fix it or leave a note so that we can watch out for it and
hopefully fix it

Make sure to export this function so that it can be used in the main function
Good luck, if you need help just ask let's do this! Happy coding!*/
