# Cpp-Choose-your-path-project.
## This is a collabrotive C++ project for Codecademy's C++ challenge.
This C++ project is a choose your own adventure game. It requires you to go through different paths in-order to find the keys.
There are 3 keys that are not easily found, since the path with the key can be different depending on if you took the right steps beforehand.
Once you find all the keys you will be able to enter them in at the Home path and, if they're correct.
You will win the game and be welcomed with a surprise.

## Future Ideas for the project
1) Create a title for the beginning of the game.
2) Create a health bar for the user.
3) Create a level system for the user. 
4) Create random moments of battles for the user in which they can either fight or run. If they run they lose some health. If they fight 2 things can happen If the opponent your fighting has a higher level than you, you lose the amount of health their level is. But if your level is higher you beat them and your level goes up one (and you might possibly gain some health).
5) Create a random key maker for every game, and keep in mind the keys in the paths would have to match those keys.
